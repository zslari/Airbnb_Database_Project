# Airbnb Database Project

Runs with AB_NYC_2019.CSV dataset

This program mimics an interface and menu with a database to navigate and filter rent prices on AirBnb using Object Oriented Design principles.

Functionality from the main Menu allows user to load a data set
and provides cross table statistics (Property Type, Location, Price) for each housing unit.

Option 1-7 functionality has been added. Option 8 loads data from a .CSV File.
