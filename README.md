# Airbnb Database Project

Runs with AB_NYC_2019.CSV dataset

This program first asks the user for their name, and then welcomes
them and asks the user for their native currency.

Functionality from the main Menu allows user to load a data set
and provides cross table statistics (Property Type, Location, Price) to
navigate rent prices on AirBnB.

Option 1-7 functionality has been added. Option 8 loads data from a .CSV File.
